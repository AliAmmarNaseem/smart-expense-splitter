const formatCurrency = (amount) => `€${amount.toFixed(2)}`;  // For EUR
const formatCurrency = (amount) => `£${amount.toFixed(2)}`;  // For GBP
```

### Default Participants
Change the initial participants in `src/TripExpenseSplitter.jsx`:

```

### Modifying Colors
Edit the Tailwind classes in the component or update `tailwind.config.js` for global changes.
